### Hi, I'm Nanjala 👋  
**Physicist turned Data Scientist | Building intuitive AI solutions**  

**About Me**  
I hold a BSc in Mathematics & Physics, where I developed a love for modeling complex systems—now I apply that rigor to machine learning and data-driven problem-solving. Passionate about interpretable AI, algorithmic fairness, and infrastructure that scales responsibly.

**Current Focus**  
- 🚀 **Building:** Next-gen conversational AI at with a focus on equitable access  
- 📊 **Exploring:** The intersection of differential geometry and neural network architectures (because old math makes new AI work better)  
- 🔒 **Securing:** ML pipelines through applied cryptography (currently implementing homomorphic encryption prototypes)  

**Tech Toolkit**  
`Python` `SQL` `TensorFlow/PyTorch` `Azure/GCP` `Docker` `Spark` | **Specialty:** Turning academic papers into production code  

**Let's Collaborate On**  
- Research-backed AI projects needing mathematical grounding  
- Open-source tools for emerging economies  
- Your cool physics/ML crossover idea (seriously, talk to me about Hamiltonian Monte Carlo)

**Fun Things**  
- 📈 Built a habit tracker using Excel + fluid dynamics metaphors  
- ♟️ Recovering chess addict (ELO 1600 and painfully aware of the Dunning-Kruger effect)  
- 🌱 **Life motto:** "If you're not failing, your models aren't ambitious enough"
